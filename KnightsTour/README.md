after cloning the repository, navigate to the KnightsTour repository.

Now you can run the executable and provide arguments

First, try running this:  ./KT 6 6 1 2


-the first two integers are the dimensions of the chess board
-the second two intergers are the coordinates for the starting position

Note: The integers for the dimensions but sum to be greater than 10

so a classic chess board is 8x8 so you would run: ./KT 8 8 3 4 or something

This can run very long or very short it all depends on the dimensions you give it and the starting coordinates
